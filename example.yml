# Values:
#   - string      write to a file

# A duration between 'ticks'. All intervals here are 'ticks'. If this
# value is set to 1 (as it should be), all ticks are roughly equivalent
# to seconds.
#
# Values: positive integers
tick: 1

# Number of seconds available for a module to generate its output when invoked..
# This value is used with Time::HiRes, so it can be a fractional number.
#
# Values: positive fractionals
timeout: 0.5

# Number of timeouts before the module is disabled entirely. This should be
# at least 1, otherwise all modules would have to be disabled instantly.
#
# Values: positive integers
timeouts: 10

# Number of failures a module can cause, either by running 'invoke' or
# an event handler. After that, the module is disabled.
#
# Values: positive integers
failures: 10

# Number of ticks to wait after trying to invoke module again. Until then,
# a warning component will be displayed instead.
#
# Values: positive integers
cooldown: 5

# Spaces to add around text entries.
#
# Values: non-negative integers
padding: 1

# An icon to use as a separator. The foreground of a separator will be
# copied from the "next" (right) component, the background will be copied
# from the "previous" (left) component.
#
# You can use separators in module definitions simply as keys without values:
#
# modules:
#     # ...
#     - separator
#     # ...
#
# Value: string
separator: î‚²

# File to load with color theme. If it does not begin with '/', will be
# searched for in the directory with the 'wild-breeze' script.
#
# Value: path
#theme: "themes/default.yml"
theme: "themes/tango.yml"

# Default values for output entry.
defaults:
    background:     "%{bg1,black}"

# If defined, uses this color instead of default background in alternating
# fashion.
#
# Values: colors or null

# Module descriptions. The following modules will be displayed from left
